Encryption and Decryption with Map
This Java program demonstrates a simple implementation of data encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) mode. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt a Map<String, String> object securely. This can be useful for protecting sensitive data such as user information.

Overview
Data security is crucial in modern software applications. This program showcases the process of encrypting a Map containing key-value pairs and then decrypting it back to its original form. It utilizes the AES-GCM encryption mode, which provides authenticated encryption and data integrity verification.

The program includes the following features:

Key generation using the AES algorithm.
Encryption of a Map<String, String> object.
Decryption of the encrypted data.
Prerequisites
Before using this program, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
A basic understanding of encryption and Java programming.
