# Encryption and Decryption with Map

## Overview

This Java program demonstrates a simple implementation of data encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) mode. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt a `String`,  `Map<String, String>` object securely. This can be useful for protecting sensitive data such as user information.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of encryption and Java programming.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/your-username/encryption-decryption-with-map.git](https://github.com/vikash0304/encryption_decryption.git)
    ```

2. **Compile the Java source code**:

    ```bash
    javac EncryptionDecryptionWithString.java
    javac EncryptionDecryptionWithMap.java
    javac EncryptionDecryptionWithCompressed.java
    ```

3. **Run the program**:

    ```bash
    java com.kr.vikash.EncryptionDecryptionWithString
    java com.kr.vikash.EncryptionDecryptionWithMap
    java com.kr.vikash.EncryptionDecryptionWithCompressed
    ```

4. The program will demonstrate encryption and decryption of a sample `String`, `Map` containing key-value pairs.

5. Customize the `Map` data and the encryption/decryption process as needed for your application.
